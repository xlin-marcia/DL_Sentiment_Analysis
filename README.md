# DL_Sentiment_Analysis

**Aim**

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying movie reviews as either positive or negative. By leveraging a recurrent neural network (RNN), the project aims to handle sequential text data, specifically from movie reviews, to identify the sentiment expressed by the reviewer.

**Dataset**

The dataset utilized in this project is the "IMDB Movie Review Dataset," which comprises a collection of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. This dataset is a standard benchmark in NLP and sentiment analysis studies, making it ideal for training and evaluating our model.

**Machine Learning Algorithms**

To tackle the sentiment analysis task, the following machine learning algorithms and techniques were employed:

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Utilized for their efficacy in processing sequences of text by capturing the contextual relationships in sentences.
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A specific type of RNN used to avoid the long-term dependency problem, allowing the model to learn and remember over longer sequences.
- Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained models to enhance the performance and training efficiency of our LSTM model.
- BERT Model
